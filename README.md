Abstract 
A novel quantum Gate AzadBinRajib (ABR) Gate is studied for Quantum computing. The ABR Gate is designed in such a manner so that the every single step done as
per the Boolean algebra for classical computer are done with the ABR quantum Gate and is proved to be working properly theoretically. The design is yet to be
 checked in practical as it justify all Boolean algebra expressions. It will do all quantum computing. ABR Gate works on dextro rotation of an angle 45Â° for 
the quantum dots. Another gate NABR means not ABR Gate which acts oppositely is also studied. It compliments the classical computer Boolean Algebra expressions.
 The ABR Gate and NABR are totally opposite to each other. 
ABR Gate is represented by 

ABR =1/sqrt(2) [0,1,1,1]

NABR = 1/sqrt(2)[1,0,0,0]

ZnS/CdS quantum dots used for study.
